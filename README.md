All pages utlilise a responsive design with pages linked through use of toggle navigation menu at the top of each page. Hyperlinked text between specific pages (i.e About - Contact) placed within paragraph content as indicated by red font. 

Dark theme with colour used sparingling for text content so as to stand out as main eye-catching content on the page.
